The ten stages to becoming a buddha
1. **Great Joy:** It is said that being close to enlightenment and seeing the benefit for all [sentient beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentient_beings_(Buddhism) "Sentient beings (Buddhism)"), one achieves great joy, hence the name. In this _bhūmi_ the bodhisattvas practice all [perfections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramita "Paramita") (_pāramitās_), but especially emphasizing [generosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_(Buddhism) "Dana (Buddhism)") (_dāna_).
2. **Stainless:** In accomplishing the second _bhūmi_, the bodhisattva is free from the stains of immorality, therefore, this _bhūmi_ is named "stainless". The emphasized perfection is [moral discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Aila "Śila") (_śīla_).
3. **Luminous:** The light of Dharma is said to radiate for others from the bodhisattva who accomplishes the third _bhūmi_. The emphasized perfection is [patience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E1%B9%A3anti "Kṣanti") (__kṣānti__).
4. **Radiant:** This _bhūmi_ it is said to be like a radiating light that fully burns that which opposes enlightenment. The emphasized perfection is [vigor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%ABrya "Vīrya") (_vīrya_).
5. **Very difficult to train:** Bodhisattvas who attain this ground strive to help sentient beings attain maturity, and do not become emotionally involved when such beings respond negatively, both of which are difficult to do. The emphasized perfection is [meditative concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhy%C4%81na_in_Buddhism "Dhyāna in Buddhism") (_dhyāna_).
6. **Obviously Transcendent:** By depending on the perfection of wisdom, [the bodhisattva] does not abide in either _[_saṃsāra_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra "Saṃsāra")_ or _[_nirvāṇa_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirv%C4%81%E1%B9%87a "Nirvāṇa")_, so this state is "obviously transcendent". The emphasized perfection is [wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_in_Buddhism "Wisdom in Buddhism") (_prajñā_).
7. **Gone afar:** Particular emphasis is on the perfection of [skillful means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upaya "Upaya") (_upāya_), to help others.
8. **Immovable:** The emphasized virtue is aspiration. This "immovable" _bhūmi_ is where one becomes able to choose his place of rebirth.
9. **Good Discriminating Wisdom:** The emphasized virtue is the understanding of self and non-self.
10. **Cloud of Dharma:** The emphasized virtue is the practice of primordial wisdom. After this _bhūmi_, one attains full Buddhahood.
