Einar's Palace is located on Omega. It is the final destination for most [[Dungeons#Challenger|challengers]] and it is where one becomes a [[Dungeons#Champion|champion]]. Those who make it here are also given the opportunity to be given a ranking.

The palace itself is huge, and only the entrance hall has been seen by anyone visiting. Everywhere else in the palace is off limits, except to the staff. The staff are all hand picked by [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] and given special [[Soul Bound Items|soul bound items]] that force loyalty and secrecy. The main visitors to the palace are those who have completed the 92 [[Dungeons|dungeons]] and new members of [[Einar's Warriors]]. When a new warrior is brought to the palace, they are greeted at the entrance hall by [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] himself, who then judges if they are fit. It is unknown as to what happens in this process and it isn't even known if someone could fail, or what would happen to them. There are no recorded cases of failure, but it's a well known rumor that anyone who might fail would have their existence erased by their clan out of shame.
