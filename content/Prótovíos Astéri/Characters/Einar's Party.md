Einar's Party consists of 18 other members. 10 of which survived to construct the 10 great clans of the modern era.

#### Tera Ashford
Leader of the [[Ashford Clan]]. She never married and instead her clan size increased after she adopted several students. Ashford is said to be obsessed with collecting swords from all over and is a master of the blade.
#### January Avrett
Leader of the [[Avrett Clan]]. Her bloodline is extremely strong and always carries on with a single daughter. Avrett boasts powerful ice magic and the castle in which she lives is constantly cold and frozen.
#### Jewel El Gracie
Leader of the [[El Gracie Clan]]. Said to be an incredible healer. After the Omega dungeon however, she broke. She was unable to heal any of the injuries suffered to her group and blamed herself. Years later, Lamberti seems to have helped her out of her depression and together they work on what El Gracie sees as her biggest failure.
#### Vincenzo Lamberti
Leader of the [[Lamberti Clan]]. After emerging from the final dungeon on Omega, he had lost both of his eyes. After conquering the planetary cluster, all of his time has gone into researching the damages done to him and his party members in order to find some way to heal them of their injuries. He was always close with El Gracie, and with his work, he spends a lot of time with her.
#### Tsukiko Mai
Leader of the [[Mai Clan]]. After emerging from the final dungeon on Omega, she had lost half of her face. Her left ear, eye, most of her nose and part of her mouth. Since the incident, Mai has always covered her face with a mask. She rarely speaks anymore. She only married once, and her husband passed many years ago. She loved him greatly and became much more recluse after his passing. It has been so long since she has used her magic, nobody is quite certain as to what it may be anymore.
#### Sameer Niu
Leader of the [[Niu Clan]]. [[Rankings]] may not place him high, but his defensive powers are said to be second to none. There are always discussions amongst the young in his clan that if he was unharmed after taking [[Amalric Einar|Einar's]] strongest attack, wouldn't that make him that strongest? Nobody has ever verified this claim however and Niu doesn't seem to wish to stop the rumors or confirm or deny them.
#### Pavel Novik
Leader of the [[Novik Clan]]. Rather than build on top of planets, Novik uses his immense earth magic to create magnificent underground cities. The planets he controls have been entirely leveled and returned to nature on the outside.
#### Ignatius Pilthash
Leader of the [[Pilthash Clan]]. He controls fire and with the help of Novik, Pilthash created a fortress in the core of a planet. His wives are forced to give birth in the fortress and only the babies that do not burn up are worthy of being called his children.
#### Rose
Leader of the [[Rose Clan]]. A very mysterious figure who hasn't been seen much since the takeover of the planetary cluster. His clan remains extremely strong and typical [[Rankings]] would place Rose 2nd place behind [[Amalric Einar|Einar]]. It is rumored his magic can control time.
#### John Smith
Leader of the [[Smith Clan]]. A very innocuous looking man, he lost his right arm in the Omega dungeon. His clan specializes in warfare, creating new firearms and battleships.

#### Lidiya Sturm
Died in the final dungeon on Omega. History says she is the only one who could rival [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] in terms of sheer power. She is also said to have been very kind, prior to joining the party she was opening orphanages to take in the victims of the war. A few [[Notable Groups#Sturm Orphanage|Sturm Orphanages]] still exist today.
#### Percival Serra
Died in the final dungeon on Omega. It is recorded Serra was a party member to [[Amalric Einar|Einar]], but all of the living members denied his existence after emerging from the dungeon. It was as if all of them had forgotten he had ever existed in the first place.
#### Romain Léon and Jean-Jacques Léon
The younger and older of the Léon brothers respectively. They both died in the final dungeon on Omega. Not much is remembered about the two except their strength. Together it is said their magic was one and together they were the strongest in the party. The Léon family line died out during the war and so they were the last two of their blood.
#### Velia Feld
Died in the final dungeon on Omega. She was extracted from the dungeon, missing the lower half. As the injuries suffered in that dungeon turned out to be unhealable, Feld perished shortly after.

#### Nova Charron
One of the few that refused the immortality contract. Died of old age shortly after they conquered the planetary cluster. Very little is actually known about him.
#### Ivan Simic
One of the few that refused the immortality contract. Died of old age shortly after they conquered the planetary cluster. Very little is actually known about him.
#### Mara
One of the few that refused the immortality contract. She lost both of her legs in the final dungeon and had fallen in love with [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] at some point during their journey. Before she passed, Mara confessed to [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] and was rejected. In some kind of act of defiance, she took the key to the dungeon on Omega and split it into ten pieces. Mara forged each of those pieces into different weapons known as the [[Shards of Mara]] and scattered them throughout the universe. Neither [[Amalric Einar|Einar]], nor the ten remaining party members ever tried to find these pieces, but collecting all of the weapons is now the goal of [[Einar's Warriors]].
