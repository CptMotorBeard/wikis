Amalric Einar, the Emperor of Mankind and ruler of the cosmos. He currently is, and always has been, number 1 in the rankings. Despite never having to use his magic after he conquered the planets, Einar's magic strength is well known and well documented as his battles tend to go the same way every time.
1. Einar creates a funnel from himself out into space, very similarly to a [[Guardians|Guardian]]. Massive amounts of [[Mana]] flows in and surrounds him. Because of this ability, it is thought that his magic type is [[Mana]] itself or that he has acquired a contract that gives him a power of the guardians. Since he was able to do this on every planet, including Eta, the contract theory is mostly one for conspiracy theorists.
2. Any attack against Einar must first go through the massive amounts of [[Mana]] surrounding him. The only recorded instance of that ever happening was a battle between Einar and [[Einar's Party#Lidiya Sturm|Lidiya Sturm]]. Sturm defeated Einar and joined his party after. This was well before they completed all the [[Dungeons|dungeons]] however, and so it is now believed that a modern Sturm would not be able to defeat the Einar of today, had she survived.
3. Einar attacks by directing raw [[Mana]] to obliterate things. His method is extremely imprecise, but he can overwhelm any opponent just by the sheer volume of [[Mana]]. He does not show much skill, just raw power.
