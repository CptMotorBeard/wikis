Guardians are the overseers of the planets. They are what allows [[Mana]] to flow into a planet. Without a guardian a planet is dead and lifeless. Nothing can live or grow on it. Guardians were thought to be and omnipotent, but at some point during the past one was killed. Eta was slain by an unknown individual, leaving the planet barren. The [[Dungeons|dungeons]] remain on the planet but are extremely difficult to access. Guardians typically do not interact with the inhabitants, but there is one exception. [[Contracts|Contracts]].

The rules of a planet are decided by the guardian. These rules must be followed. The [[10 Great Clans]] have entered [[Contracts|contracts]] with the various Guardians that allow them to create and enforce rules, which makes them almost gods on their own planets.
