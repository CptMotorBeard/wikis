#### Years unknown
[[Guardians]] were thought to be immortal and omnipotent, but at some point during the past one was killed. Eta was slain by an unknown individual, leaving the planet barren. The dungeons remain on the planet but are extremely difficult to access.
#### ~25,000 years ago
This is roughly where most of history starts for the previous era. War ravaged the [[Planetary Cluster]]. Each of the planets were governed by different individuals and all of them wanted control of the system. The [[Guardians]] did not participate in the war, even if a planet was to be overtaken, they remained neutral. Rule of planets changed hands constantly and any history older than this is hard to find. Documents and books of the enemies were constantly being burned, art and inventions destroyed. The genocide of entire races and cultures happened quite often.
#### ~18,000 years ago
[[Amalric Einar]] began conquering the [[Dungeons|dungeons]], an act which was deemed quite useless before now. [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] was not very strong and so this was his quest to gain strength. He was accepted to challenge the [[Dungeons|dungeons]] by Zero and began his journey to the 23 planets to challenge the 4 [[Dungeons|dungeons]] on each.
#### ~17, 500 years ago
[[Amalric Einar|Einar]] had amassed a large [[Einar's Party|party]] over the past 500 years, a group of 18 talented mages and warriors. Together they fought through the planets and managed to complete all 92 [[Dungeons|dungeons]]. His group became the first to complete the dungeons and that seemed to cause a change in the planets. Omega, a wasteland of a planet, suddenly gained a [[Guardians|guardian]], and a new [[Dungeons|dungeon]]. [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] and his group travelled to Omega and talked to the [[Guardians|guardian]]. They were offered a [[Contracts|contract]] removing their ability to die from old age and told that completing the final dungeon would open up the cosmos as well as grant them any wish. Only 3 in the party refused the [[Contracts|contract]] and the entire group entered the [[Dungeons|dungeon]].
#### ~15, 500 years ago
There was interest in [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] and his group when he went into the [[Dungeons|dungeon]] however, years passed and they never emerged and so they were presumed dead. Around 2000 years after [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] and his group entered the dungeon, they emerged. Of his group, less than half were unscathed. 5 had died and 5 more were severely injured with unhealable injuries and for some reason, even those who did not take the contract had not aged. Despite the sacrifices, [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] was unable to complete the final [[Dungeons|dungeon]]. They did realize something with their defeat. Each of them was far stronger then the start of their journey and, together, they had the strength to conquer nations. Using that strength, the group decided to seal the final [[Dungeons|dungeon]] and conquer the known universe.
#### ~15, 300 years ago
It only took the group a couple hundred years to conquer the war-torn planetary cluster. Two of [[Einar's Party]] died of old age during this time, placing the total number of members down to 12. 10 of the remaining party members set off to become the rulers of several planets and start [[10 Great Clans|clans]] to keep their rule even after many years. Only [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] and [[Einar's Party#Mara|Mara]] remained on Omega. [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] constructed a [[Einar's Palace|great palace]] surrounding the final [[Dungeons|dungeon]]. Along with the seal the party placed on it, nobody would be able to get in.
#### ~15, 200 years ago
It took about 100 years for the construction of various castles, fortresses and villas, but [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] and his [[Einar's Party|party]] had stabilized the [[Planetary Cluster|planetary cluster]] and their rule. [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] sat at the top, as the Emperor, with his [[Einar's Party|party members]] directly below him as rulers. [[Einar's Party#Mara|Mara]] continued to stay at [[Amalric Einar|Einar's]] side. [[Einar's Party]] established [[Contracts|contracts]] with the various [[Guardians|guardians]] of the planets they ruled over. These contracts ensured that they would always be the one true rulers.
#### ~15, 000 years ago
[[Amalric Einar|Einar's]] rule had only grown stronger over the years, but [[Einar's Party#Mara|Mara's]] time was up. She did not take the contract from Omega and she only had a decade more at most. [[Einar's Party#Mara|Mara]] had fallen in love with [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] over their journey and so she decided to confess now, so she wouldn't leave her life with any regrets. One evening she approached [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] in his study. It was a private conversation, so the contents are unknown, but it ended with shouting and [[Einar's Party#Mara|Mara]] leaving very angry. She stole the key that seals Omega's dungeon and fled Omega. In the next few years she melted down the key and forged pieces of it into various different weapons. Those weapons are known as [[Shards of Mara]]. [[Einar's Party#Mara|Mara]] then took those weapons, and with her few remaining years, hid them in various places throughout the [[Planetary Cluster|planetary cluster]]. For some reason, neither [[Amalric Einar|Einar]], nor the remaining living party members, ever tried to find any of the pieces.
#### ~10, 000 years ago
[[Amalric Einar|Einar's]] rule continued peacefully. He became known as the Emperor of Mankind. His living party members remained the clan heads of their respective clans, which had grown to the point where it was impossible to find places not under their influence. Their rule was an absolute at this point, and nobody questioned it any more. [[Amalric Einar|Einar's]] attendants had a problem however. At some point he had become unable to have children. Despite his strength and immortality, they wanted to plan for the worst and have an heir for [[Amalric Einar|Einar]]. This lead to the creation of [[Einar's Warriors]]. One of whom would eventually become [[Amalric Einar|Einar's]] heir, inheriting the universe.
#### ~8, 000 years ago
Having so solidly cemented their positions, the clan heads decided to institute some changes. The first was [[Rankings]]. After [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] and his party conquered all of the [[Dungeons|dungeons]] as well as the planetary cluster, it became quite common for individuals to try conquering all of the [[Dungeons|dungeons]] as well. Of course none could challenge the final [[Dungeons|dungeon]], but the [[Rankings|rankings]] would reflect individual strength across all of the conquerable [[Dungeons|dungeons]]. The second was contracts. Named after the [[Contracts|contracts]] of [[Guardians|guardians]], the clan heads started issuing contracts, general requests, to the individuals in their clan. Those who were able to complete the challenges listed in the contract would receive rewards, sometimes from the clan head themselves. Both of these were quite popular, and pushed the growth and competition of the clans.
#### ~5, 000 years ago
Roughly 10, 000 years after being hidden, the first [[Shards of Mara|Shard of Mara]] was found by an individual conquering the [[Dungeons|dungeons]]. The strange [[Soul Bound Items|soul bound]] weapon was analyzed and its past uncovered. Despite no decree by [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] himself, the unofficial goal of [[Einar's Warriors]] became to collect all of the [[Shards of Mara]] and reform the key to Omega. Many bloody battles were fought over the first shard.
#### ~2, 000 years ago
It didn't take nearly as long for the rest of the [[Shards of Mara]] to be found once their existence became known. Around 3, 000 more years went by and all of the [[Shards of Mara]] had been found. Each belonged to different clans and different warriors. Some of them are lost for years during this period after a battle only to be found and fought for once more. At this point in time, most of the clan heads seem to be distancing themselves from each other, besides [[Einar's Party#Jewel El Gracie|El Gracie]] and [[Einar's Party#Vincenzo Lamberti|Lamberti]]. [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] no longer seems to be interfering with any of the happenings, allowing everything to progress without him.
#### Modern Day
[[Amalric Einar|Einar]] hasn't been seen in public in quite some time. His [[Rankings|ranking]] remains first, though, since the [[Rankings|ranking]] system has mostly been taken over by the [[Notable Characters#Sigmund Hall|people]], his first place ranking is now a position of hot debate. The clan heads also haven't made any moves in recent years either. Their clans mostly run themselves and skirmishes and battles between clans isn't uncommon. So long as it doesn't escalate to a full out war, the clan heads seem content. There are hundreds of [[Einar's Warriors]] but a few [[Shards of Mara]] are currently missing. Contracts are still given out by clans, but now they are mostly for jobs that the clan requires or requests from those who can't complete a task themselves. [[Rankings|Ranking]] is still mostly based on individual power, but there is a portion of popularity contest to it now. A small clan sprung up with individuals from each of the various clans in order to determine ranking. Other small clans appeared throughout the years as well, mostly being offshoots of the [[10 Great Clans]].
