The planetary cluster is known as Prótovíos Astéri. There are 25 planets in Prótovíos Astéri. Only 3 are notably different from the rest. The planets are named after the guardians of the planets, as a sign of respect for them. With the exception of Zero and Omega, which only have 1 known [[Dungeons|dungeon]], all other planets have 4 [[Dungeons|dungeons]].

There is nothing outside of the planetary cluster besides a [[Mana|sea of Mana]], and so the entire known universe is within travel distance of any individual. It is said that the final [[Dungeons|dungeon]] can open up the cosmos, so it is theorized that there is more to the universe that is waiting to be unlocked.
##### Zero
Zero is the only [[Guardians|guardian]] that most individuals will ever interact with. In order to challenge any of the [[Dungeons|dungeons]], one must first complete a trial and form a [[Contracts|contract]] with Zero. It will then provide you with a [[Dungeons#Key|dungeon key]] in order to identify yourself as a [[Dungeons#Challenger|dungeon challenger]].
#### Eta
The guardian Eta was killed and so the planet remains lifeless and uninhabited. 4 [[Dungeons|dungeons]] still remain on this planet and so to complete all 92, one must find a way to brave this lifeless place.
#### Omega
Omega contains the final [[Dungeons|dungeon]], which was sealed by [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] and his [[Einar's Party|party]]. [[Amalric Einar|Einar]] currently lives on this planet inside [[Einar's Palace|his palace]] and for the most part it is restricted to enter. The exception to this is new [[Einar's Warriors]] and to [[Dungeons#Challenger|challengers]] who have completed all 92 [[Dungeons|dungeons]] who are given special permission to enter the [[Einar's Palace|palace]] on Omega where they are crowned as [[Dungeons#Champion|champions]].
