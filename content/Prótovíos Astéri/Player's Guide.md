For one reason or another, you find yourself at a [[Notable Groups#Sturm Orphanage|Sturm Orphanage]] on Chi. Whether the reason is work, you yourself are an orphan, or anything else, you have lived at the orphanage for a few years now. During this time you have developed up to tier 3 magic, a level of control over [[Mana]] that not many achieve. [[Notable Characters#Argus Pilthash|Argus Pilthash]] has approached the orphanage, hoping to take some talent on a journey to [[Planetary Cluster#Zero|Zero]]. Whatever the reason for accepting, you decide you wish to become a [[Dungeons#Challenger|challenger]] and follow [[Notable Characters#Argus Pilthash|Argus Pilthash's]] guidance.

- 2 traits are allowed, only 1 may be one of the following custom traits. The custom traits may have story implications as well as their provided benefit and are only ever allowed to be taken at level 1

### Custom Traits
#### Attuned with Mana
For some reason your body accepts mana much more naturally then others. You recover mana out of combat twice as fast, meaning it only takes a 5 minute rest to fully recover. In addition, all dice rolled for mana are treated as being 1 higher than the roll.
#### Hated by Mana
For some reason your body does not accept mana very well. It takes you twice as long to recover mana out of combat, meaning it takes a 20 minute rest to fully recover. You must take a D4 for your mana dice. You gain SR equal to 2x your level
#### Contracted
Start with a [[Contracts|contract]] with Chi. Details of the contract will be determined as part of character creation and balancing.
#### Healthy
You are born extra sturdy. Increase your HD by 1 rank, this does not affect your mana die. 1D12 increases to 2D6. In addition, all dice rolled for health are treated as being 1 higher than the roll.
#### Strong Soul
Those with a strong soul only die 1d4 rounds after they would normally. The soul remains tethered to the body during this period and if they are healed to full, they revive.
#### Lucky Bastard
This has no obvious effects. Let me know if you take it though.
#### Unlucky Bastard
This has no obvious effects. Let me know if you take it though.
