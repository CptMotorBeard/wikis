Except in exceptional circumstances, only a [[Dungeons#Champion|Dungeon Champion]] can be placed on the rankings. The rankings are finalized by [[Notable Characters#Sigmund Hall|Sigmund Hall]] and [[Notable Groups#The Ranking Organization|The Ranking Organization]]. There are a total of 85, 000 ranked [[Dungeons#Champion|champions]]. Not all [[Dungeons#Champion|champions]] are ranked as it requires their consent once they enter [[Einar's Palace]]. Dead individuals are removed from the rankings immediately, with the positions below them all moving up. For those who very much care about the rankings, defeating higher rank individuals is a popular way to move up.
