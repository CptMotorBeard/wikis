#### Occupied Planets
- Zeta
- Psi (Capital)

Zeta and Psi are extremely popular tourist attractions. The entirety of the planet is covered in nature and animals where various safaris and explorations take place. The cities are all underground, courtesy of [[Einar's Party#Pavel Novik|Pavel Novik]]. Initially, this provided the clan with immense wealth from all of the metals and minerals that were extracted, but those have dried up now leaving the clan to mostly be funded off of tourism. Magic is used to create a virtual sky in the underground cities, so living in them is almost no different from living in any other city.
