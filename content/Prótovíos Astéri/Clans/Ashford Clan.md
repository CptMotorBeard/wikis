The Ashford Clan focuses on skill with the blade. [[Einar's Party#Tera Ashford|Tera Ashford's]] direct disciples became her adopted children and their descendants make up a large number of the current leaders of the clan. Those who are skilled with the blade can rise to positions of power within the clan and there are many dojos around the planets for students to increase their prowess. On Delta, there is a large, dojo where [[Einar's Party#Tera Ashford|Tera Ashford]] lives. She can be found training most days in the outdoor portion. Below the dojo is the Ashford collection of blades. An absolute treasure trove, containing some of the most impressive relics ever found in dungeons. It is rumored that The [[Shards of Mara|Shard of Delusion]] is held within the collection, but nobody has seen it there so the claim is unverified.
