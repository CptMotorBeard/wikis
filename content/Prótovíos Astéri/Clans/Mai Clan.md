The mask of [[Einar's Party#Tsukiko Mai|Tsukiko Mai]] is a very popular thing for a bride to wear at a wedding. The story of her never remarrying despite having lived several lifetimes beyond her husband is also very popular amongst the romantics. Xi is the most popular spot for honeymoons as there is a superstition that if a married couple repeats their vows at the statue of [[Einar's Party#Tsukiko Mai|Tsukiko Mai]] in the square, they will forever be happy. [[Einar's Party#Tsukiko Mai|Tsukiko Mai]] herself is rarely seen anymore, she hasn't been active in thousands of years. She is still highly respected amongst The Mai clan and they have become self sufficient, not interacting much with the other clans.
