[[Einar's Party#Sameer Niu|Sameer Niu]] and the Niu clan have a pretty low profile. The members of the Niu clan have great pride in defensive magic and the planets of Iota and Nu are the most well defended places in the universe. Various banks and individuals keep vast amount of wealth on these planets, knowing that nobody would ever be able to break in and steal it. Even with the various skirmishes between the other clans, the Niu clan has never participated in a battle. They are seen as an absolute neutral party and often times asked to be arbiters for fights. There are various arenas over the planets designed and managed by the Niu clan that allow for all out duels but protect the individuals participating from death or serious injury.
