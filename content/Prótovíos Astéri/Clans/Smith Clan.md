The capital of Pi is heavily industrialized and works quite closely with Upsilon and the [[Lamberti Clan]] for the production of everything that they need to continue their research. [[Einar's Party#Jon Smith|Jon Smith]] is at the forefront of the Weaponry division and all of the other divisions were created over the years due to needs from the Weaponry division.
