Mara split the key of Omega into 10 shards

- Shard of Greed; A dagger
- Shard of Hate; A sickle
- Shard of Delusion; A katana
- Shard of Conceit; A longsword
- Shard of Vision; A bow
- Shard of Doubt; A greataxe
- Shard of Torpor; A mace
- Shard of Excitement; A gauntlet
- Shard of Conscience; A gun
- Shard of Disregard; A spear

Collecting all of these weapons is now the goal of [[Einar's Warriors]]. After learning about them and their [[History#~5, 000 years ago|history]], they decided that the one who was able to collect all of the weapons and return the shards into the key would be the most worthy to become [[Amalric Einar|Einar's]] successor.
