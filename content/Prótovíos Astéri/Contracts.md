Contracts are complex magical agreements given out by [[Guardians]]. The one universal contract is given out by [[Planetary Cluster#Zero|Zero]] to allow someone to become a [[Dungeons#Challenger|challenger]]. [[Planetary Cluster#Zero|Zero]] gives out a [[Dungeons#Key|dungeon key]] in exchange for completing his challenge. The other well known contract was given out by Omega, eternal life to [[Einar's Party]]. It is unknown what they had to exchange for such a reward.

Most creatures will never come into contact with a [[Guardians|Guardian]] for them to receive any contract besides the one for a [[Dungeons#Key|dungeon key]]. It is unknown how [[Guardians]] decide to hand out contracts, but individuals who do have contracts tend to keep them hidden, as the benefits of a contract can typically only be used on the planet of the [[Guardians|Guardian]]. The exchange for contracts also seems rather arbitrary, as there are records of great rewards being given for almost nothing as well as detrimental rewards being given out at a steep price. Accepting a contract is not obligatory but [[Guardians]] have never been recorded interacting with someone who has turned down their contract. A division of the [[Smith Clan]] will pay for verifiable information about contracts.
